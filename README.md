#  Example: Anonymize PII data using Microsoft Presidio

This example starts a simple Robocorp Assistant with only one text input. Write anything in,
and in the next view the PII data has been replaced with placeholders.

This uses a very basic configuration of [Microsoft Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/)
and only works in English as of now. The expansion possibilities are endless, including writing
custom recognizers.
